      "Although not so well attended as last year, the Camp at\n",
      "Chiswick has been, taking all things into consideration, an\n",
      "unqualified success. From a purely military point of view it is\n",
      "to be regretted that, owing to the absence of the officers on\n",
      "house hunting and other expeditions, the drills have not been\n",
      "so well attended as they were last year, but the Camp should\n",
      "prove as successful as ever as an experience in the art of\n",
      "making oneself “ comfy” under strange conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Favoured by glorious weather, the campers soon managed\n",
      "to get fit, and several of the party who had previous to June 1st\n",
      "begun to feel the effects of a strenuous season of dances,\n",
      "dinners, smokers, etc., are now very fit. Also the “ Stork” has\n",
      "blossomed forth as a chef; his scrambled eggs on Sunday\n",
      "mornings were a scream of joy, to say nothing of his pancakes\n",
      "a la Yorkshire pudding.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bicycle polo has provided the young bloods with splendid\n",

      "one rule to be observed in this game and that is that you must\n",
      "use another fellow’s bike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bowls, tennis, golf, and catchball have frequently been\n",

      "all to himself. The venerable Vincent, who seems to grow\n",
      "younger every day, is beginning to fancy his weight at tennis,\n",

      "Trick cycling exhibitions by Sandy and Watty have helped\n",

      "Victoria to Dover. The platform was crowded with friends who\n",

      "the 2 a.m. boat and had a very pieasant crossing to Ostend,\n",
      "when we were greeted with a nice little shower which, lasted\n",
      "until Sunday afternoon. Despite the drips we enjoyed\n",

      "\n",
      "The Choir gave their first concert on Saturday evening in\n",

      "over a mile. There are several large high-domed buildings used,\n",
      "one as a Chapel and another as Concert Hall, where we gave our\n",
      "Concert. Upon the King’s arrival we sang the Chant National\n",
      "Belge and three cheers for the King, after which we followed\n",
      "with ‘God save the King.’ The Programme chosen by King\n",
      "Albert included “ Pan,” “O Gladsome Light,” “ Land of Hope\n",
      "and Glory,” etc. ; at the conclusion the King and Dr. Harries had\n",
      "quite a long confab, during which the King expressed his pleasure\n",
      "at the Concert, highly complimenting the Choir and wishing us\n",
      "success in our work. We were entertained in another part of\n",
      "the Conservatory, refreshments being served by the Royal\n",
      "footmen, King Albert remaining and chatting with the heads of\n",
      "the choir, until we had almost completed the demolition of the\n",
      "viands (oh Todd!) after which we returned to Brussels and from\n",
      "6 to 8 p.m. had a run round making purchases. Owing to an\n",
      "accident on the line (not our fault) we did not reach Ostend\n",
      "until after midnight, when we embarked and proceeded home;\n",
      "the crossing was not so smooth as the outward journey, and it\n",
      "is rumoured there were painful sights. We eventually arrived\n",

      "a rather poor audience on this occasion, owing no doubt to its\n",

      "name was originally “Innis-Faithlenn” or the Island_ of\n",
      "Faithlenn, after a man who lived upon it centuries ago. Here\n",

      "free of any charges whatever. The ancient—and undoubtedly\n",
      "the more beautiful name of the Lower Lake was ‘Loch\n",

      "\n",
      "Previous to the time that the Normans came to Ireland\n",
      "1177 A.D., there were few, if any, stone buildings in the\n",
      "country which were used as fortresses. According to ancient\n",
      "traditions this was owing to the fact that the Irish considered\n",
      "it unworthy and as showing a lack of valour to fight anywhere\n",
      "excepting in the open. As one bard ex, ressed himself when\n",
      "writing against the innovation of castles being built by his\n",
      "countrymen: “ Our ancestors trusted entirely to their personal\n",
      "valour, and thought the stone houses of the Gauls a disgrace to\n",
      "courage, yet we are now erecting and using these habitations\n",
      "of cowards,” Circumstances, however, were too strong, and\n",
      "from this time forward castles were built all over Ireland, as the\n",
      "natives found that without them tney were helpless against the\n",
      "Norman invaders. Thus it was that during the thirteenth or\n",
      "fourteenth century Ross Castle was built by one of the leading\n",
      "chieftains of the Mac Carthy-mor clan, the clan which was the\n",
      "strongest and held the most territory in south-west Ireland.\n",
      "This chieftain, the O'Donoghue Ross, was a man of great gifts,\n",
      "being spoken of by one writer of the time as “Like unto the\n",
      "demi-gods of old—a contemner of danger, a passionate admirer\n",
      "of whatever is great and honourable. The severity of his war-\n",
      "like virtues was tempered by a generous hospitality which\n",
      "embracad a friend in every stranger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This O'Donoghue is still the hero of heroes round Killarney,\n",
      "and wherever you go in the neighbourhood you are sure to\n",
      "come into touch with something around which has been woven\n",
      "a legend of the remarkable “ O’Donoghue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The position of the castle was wonderfully well chosen as a\n",
      "place of defence and for many centuries it was the principal\n",
      "fortress in the south-west of Ireland, whilst the men composing\n",
      "the force of the chieftain were undoubtedly amongst the ablest\n",
      "opponents which the Normans found in the country. Not until\n",
      "the reign of Queen Elizabeth did the castle pass out of the\n",
      "keeping of the O’Donoghues, but in that reign we find that it\n",
      "was confiscated and given into the hands of Sir Valentine\n",
      "Brown, and in this family it has remained ever since; the\n",
      "present proprietor, the Earl of Kenmare, being the direct\n",
      "descendant of Sir Valentine.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the time of the Cromwellian Wars, however, we find\n",
      "that the castle was still one of the sharpest thorns in the side\n",
      "of the English troops; and it was the last in Ireland to fall to\n",
      "General Ludlow, one of the ablest of Cromwell's Officers. This\n",
      "was in 1642. Just previously the Irish forces, under Lord\n",
      "Muskerry, had been defeated at the battle of Kuocknicklaskey,\n",
      "in County Cork, and had retired to Ross Castle where they\n",
      "were beseiged by the English army. An old tradition existed\n",
      "that the castle would never be taken until foreign warships\n",
      "appeared upon the Lakes of Killarney, and General Ludlow,\n",
      "realizing the strength of jthe place against an attack upon the\n",
      "land side, conceived the idea of bringing boats up the river\n",
      "Laune and attacking it from the water. This he accomplished,\n",
      "and the defenders, remembering the old tradition, completely\n",
      "lost heart and surrendered after a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time until the beginning of the nineteenth\n",
      "century it was, at different periods, the headquarters of English\n",

      "BOXING CLUB.— On Wednesday\n",
      "last our annual competitions for novices\n",
      "were held in the Small Lecture Hall,\n",
      "before a large audience, which tested its\n",
      "holding capacity to its fullest extent. In\n",
      "some of the events the winners showed\n",
      "promising form, while, among the losers,\n",
      "Geddes, Wallace, and Jermin should be\n",
      "heard of again. The following are the\n",
      "details:—7 st. 10 1b. Competttion.—G.\n",
      "Geddes beat A. Green. These youngsters\n",
      "were evenly matched in size and ability,\n",
      "Geddes forging ahead in the last round,\n",
      "when Green retired within ten seconds\n",
      "of time. A. Murray beat J. Murphy.\n",
      "The latter stood right over Murray, who\n",
      "is a brether of George of that ilk.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Murray made tracks fast with a straight\n",
      "left, but Murphy’s height and defence\n",
      "prevented much damage being done. At\n",
      "outfighting, Murray had the best of the\n",
      "exchanges, but at close quarters he lost\n",
      "himself, and had all the worst of the\n",
      "scrambles. Pulling himself together in the\n",
      "last round, Murray displayed the better\n",
      "generalship, and managed to secure the\n",
      "verdict, although Murphy made a very\n",
      "creditable show. Final bout : A. Murray\n",
      "beat G. Geddes. Murray started very\n",
      "fast, but Geddes countered him effectively,\n",
      "and would not bestalled off. The scoring\n",
      "was rather in favour of Murray, whose\n",
      "leading-off propensities carried in front\n",
      "by the end of the second round. Coming\n",
      "up for the third time Murray still forced\n",
      "the work, but Geddes, who has an excel-\n",
      "lent right, crossed him splendidly time\n",
      "after time, and had the better of the\n",
      "business up to the end of the round. The\n",
      "judge, however, did not think he had\n",
      "done sufficient to wipe off the lead gained\n",
      "by Murray in the first two rounds, and\n",
      "the latter secured the verdict. 854 420.\n",
      "Competition.—J. Ferguson beat E. Bevan.\n",
      "There was a marked disparity in the sizes\n",
      "of these men, Ferguson being some inches\n",
      "taller than his sturdy opponent. Aided\n",
      "by his reach Ferguson cut out the pace,\n",
      "but Bevan met him coolly every time, and\n",
      "hitting the harder of the two, looked like\n",
      "staying the longer. The boxing was\n",
      "of a give and take character right\n",
      "up to the finish, but Ferguson’s extra\n",
      "reach enabled him to be _ generally\n",
      "first in the exchanges, and he won.\n",
      "9 st. Competition.—G. F. Kingham beat\n",
      "E. Ellerton. The latter looked frail\n",
      "beside Kingham, who is a very strong\n",
      "boxer at the weight. Ellerton shaped\n",
      "very well, but the heavier metal carried\n",
      "by Kingham proved too much for his\n",
      "plucky opponent, who had to put up with\n",
      "second place after an interesting bout. J.\n",
      "Wallace beat J. Liddle. Wallace, the\n",
      "shorter of the two, posed the most\n",
      "artistically, and repeatedly found his way\n",
      "to Liddle’s dial by means of well-directed\n",
      "left-handers, summing up a sequence of\n",
      "points in the first round. In the second\n",
      "round, Liddle held out his hand and\n",
      "retired. Final bout: G. F. Kingham\n",
      "beat J. Wallace. Wallace, who was much\n",
      "below the stipulated weight, soon looked\n",
      "like taking a big lead, but Kingham\n",
      "would not be denied, and went after his\n",
      "man, banging him heavily with both\n",
      "hands whenever opportunity offered,\n",
      "there being little in it at the end of the\n",
      "first round. The same style of boxing\n",
      "was indulged in during the remaining\n",
      "rounds, Wallace having the best of the\n",
      "earlier stages, but Kingham, served by\n",
      "by his extra weight and strength, gradually\n",
      "wore his opponent down and was declared\n",
      "the winner. I0 st. Competition.—J.\n",
      "Collins beat T. Chandler. The latter\n",
      "took a most formidable lead in the first\n",
      "minute and ahalf, and then retired for\n",
      "some reason best known to himself. W. R.\n",
      "Davey beat A. Bannister. The latter is.\n",
      "a bit of a rusher, and shapes in rather\n",
      "peculiar style, but Davey, standing well\n",
      "up to his work, and hitting cleaner, gained\n",
      "the decision, after a well fought bout. F.\n",
      "Hazzledine beat C. S. Skeats. A well-\n",
      "matched pair. Hazzledine has a good\n",
      "left hand, and got home repeatedly, owing\n",
      "to Skeats dropping his head each time he\n",
      "led off. From start to finish Hazzledine\n",
      "had the best of it, but could not hit\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Skeats hard enough to stop him, and the\n",
      "latter was loudly cheered by the specta-\n",
      "tors for his grand display of courage under\n",
      "difficulties. Final bout: F. Hazzledine\n",
      "beat J. Collins. Davey, having injured\n",
      "his thumb, retired and left the above two\n",
      "to decide who should possess the hand-\n",
      "some medal. Collins, a well-built lad, is\n",
      "well known for his all-round athletic\n",
      "ability, having distinguished himself both\n",
      "at running and cycling, and was a com-\n",
      "petitor in the recent long distance\n",
      "swimming championship. Jim had orders\n",
      "to cut out the work, which he did at a\n",
      "lively bat, but he was met every time\n",
      "with some splendid, clean, hard shots\n",
      "from Hazzledine’s left. The latter boxed\n",
      "very steadily, and, served by his extra\n",
      "reach, had the best of someheavy fighting,\n",
      "in which the staying powers of both men\n",
      "were severely tested. The excitement was\n",
      "kept up right to the end of the third round,\n",
      "when the award very properly went to\n",
      "Hazzledine. Catch Weight—F¥. Pollitzer\n",
      "beat G. Jerrim. Pollitzer, who is of the\n",
      "greyhound breed, looked very fit, while\n",
      "Jerrim appeared as hard as nails. The\n",
      "latter was much the shorter of the twain,\n",
      "but there could not be much between\n",
      "them in the matter of weight. Pollitzer\n",
      "led off with the left and repeated the\n",
      "liberty, Jerrim standing still and making\n",
      "very little attempt either to hit or guard.\n",
      "Pollitzer still kept up the pressure, and at\n",
      "last Jerrim let both hands go heavily,\n",
      "which caused the long ’un to keep at a\n",
      "respectful distance. Up for the second\n",
      "round Pollitzer welted his opponent some-\n",
      "what severely in the ribs several times in\n",
      "succession, to the intense amusement of\n",
      "Jerrim, who time after time failed to make\n",
      "use of himself when advantages occurred.\n",
      "During the short rest, he was severely\n",
      "admonished by his second, which caused\n",
      "him to alter the aspect of affairs altogether,\n",
      "and if he had forced the pace in the pre-\n",
      "vious rounds, the decision might have\n",
      "been different. As it was, using both\n",
      "hands with good effect, he rapidly im-\n",
      "proved his position, but when the voice\n",
      "of the timekeeper stopped hostilities, he\n",
      "had not scored sufficient in the eyes of\n",
      "the judges to secure the trophy, which\n",
      "accordingly went to Pollitzer. The judg-\n",
      "ing was kindly undertaken by Messrs.\n",
