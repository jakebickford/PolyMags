      "Although not so well attended as last year, the Camp at\n",
      "Chiswick has been, taking all things into consideration, an\n",
      "unqualified success. From a purely military point of view it is\n",
      "to be regretted that, owing to the absence of the officers on\n",
      "house hunting and other expeditions, the drills have not been\n",
      "so well attended as they were last year, but the Camp should\n",
      "prove as successful as ever as an experience in the art of\n",
      "making oneself “ comfy” under strange conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Favoured by glorious weather, the campers soon managed\n",
      "to get fit, and several of the party who had previous to June 1st\n",
      "begun to feel the effects of a strenuous season of dances,\n",
      "dinners, smokers, etc., are now very fit. Also the “ Stork” has\n",

      "Bicycle polo has provided the young bloods with splendid\n",

      "one rule to be observed in this game and that is that you must\n",
      "use another fellow’s bike.\n",

      "ROSS CASTLE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous to the time that the Normans came to Ireland\n",
      "1177 A.D., there were few, if any, stone buildings in the\n",
      "country which were used as fortresses. According to ancient\n",
      "traditions this was owing to the fact that the Irish considered\n",
      "it unworthy and as showing a lack of valour to fight anywhere\n",
      "excepting in the open. As one bard ex, ressed himself when\n",
      "writing against the innovation of castles being built by his\n",
      "countrymen: “ Our ancestors trusted entirely to their personal\n",
      "valour, and thought the stone houses of the Gauls a disgrace to\n",
      "courage, yet we are now erecting and using these habitations\n",
      "of cowards,” Circumstances, however, were too strong, and\n",
      "from this time forward castles were built all over Ireland, as the\n",
      "natives found that without them tney were helpless against the\n",
      "Norman invaders. Thus it was that during the thirteenth or\n",
      "fourteenth century Ross Castle was built by one of the leading\n",
      "chieftains of the Mac Carthy-mor clan, the clan which was the\n",
      "strongest and held the most territory in south-west Ireland.\n",
      "This chieftain, the O'Donoghue Ross, was a man of great gifts,\n",
      "being spoken of by one writer of the time as “Like unto the\n",
      "demi-gods of old—a contemner of danger, a passionate admirer\n",
      "of whatever is great and honourable. The severity of his war-\n",
      "like virtues was tempered by a generous hospitality which\n",
      "embracad a friend in every stranger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This O'Donoghue is still the hero of heroes round Killarney,\n",
      "and wherever you go in the neighbourhood you are sure to\n",
      "come into touch with something around which has been woven\n",
      "a legend of the remarkable “ O’Donoghue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The position of the castle was wonderfully well chosen as a\n",
      "place of defence and for many centuries it was the principal\n",
      "fortress in the south-west of Ireland, whilst the men composing\n",
      "the force of the chieftain were undoubtedly amongst the ablest\n",
      "opponents which the Normans found in the country. Not until\n",
      "the reign of Queen Elizabeth did the castle pass out of the\n",
      "keeping of the O’Donoghues, but in that reign we find that it\n",
      "was confiscated and given into the hands of Sir Valentine\n",
      "Brown, and in this family it has remained ever since; the\n",
      "present proprietor, the Earl of Kenmare, being the direct\n",
      "descendant of Sir Valentine.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the time of the Cromwellian Wars, however, we find\n",
      "that the castle was still one of the sharpest thorns in the side\n",
      "of the English troops; and it was the last in Ireland to fall to\n",
      "General Ludlow, one of the ablest of Cromwell's Officers. This\n",
      "was in 1642. Just previously the Irish forces, under Lord\n",
      "Muskerry, had been defeated at the battle of Kuocknicklaskey,\n",
      "in County Cork, and had retired to Ross Castle where they\n",
      "were beseiged by the English army. An old tradition existed\n",
      "that the castle would never be taken until foreign warships\n",
      "appeared upon the Lakes of Killarney, and General Ludlow,\n",
      "realizing the strength of jthe place against an attack upon the\n",
      "land side, conceived the idea of bringing boats up the river\n",
      "Laune and attacking it from the water. This he accomplished,\n",
      "and the defenders, remembering the old tradition, completely\n",
      "lost heart and surrendered after a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time until the beginning of the nineteenth\n",
      "century it was, at different periods, the headquarters of English\n",
      "troops, but for a hundred years it has been uninhabited and\n",
      "now, being overgrown with ivy and creepers, and situated in\n",
      "the midst of such lovely scenery, is one of the most delightful\n",
      "old ruins to be imagined,\n",

      "it showed all those multitudes who had crowded to hear\n",
      "Him in the morning, leaving Him, discontented and\n",

      "would’st not” be healed of your sin? You would, if you dared,\n",
      "goaway. My boy, you may go. The kingdom, of heaven is\n",

      "said the leper, “ Thou can’st make me clean.” “ /f you can do\n",
      "anything,” said the father of the lunatic boy, “help us.” Christ\n",
      "gently put these “ifs” in the right place. “The question is\n",
      "not,” He said, “if I desire to heal, but if you desire to be\n",
      "healed.” The doubt is not whether the Divine forgiveness is\n",
      "willing to flow into your soul, but whether you are willing to\n",
      "open the sin-barred door to take Him for your Lord. There\n",
      "never was any reluctance in God’s heart to save you. There is\n",
      "none this afternoon. The prodigal thought he had to overcome\n",
      "some unwillingness, for he went with the prayer, ‘ Make me one\n",
      "of thine hired servants.” Ay, he must do some scrubbing, and\n",
      "polishing, and boot-blacking to overcome the unwillingness in\n",
      "his father’s heart to save him. You will remember the gracious\n",
      "response, “ My son! myson!” The boy’s place had always been\n",
      "empty, the boy’s absence had always been felt, the son had\n",

      "“ Would’st thou” be healed this afternoon, and if so, why ?\n",

      "Sonship is already wuthin you, and the name of “Child” is\n",
      "trembling on the Father’s lips. Better this, surely, than you\n",
