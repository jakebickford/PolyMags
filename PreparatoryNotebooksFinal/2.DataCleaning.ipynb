hon see   rr  the reading circle  friday last being the first day in the circle year mr durrant held a reception of the members in the marlborough room the feature of the evening was an introductory lecture on  dr johnson and the wits of his time by mr denison allport plunging at once into the subject with a vigour so characteristic of the lecturer we were treated to a very fine word portrait of the sage of bolt court who dressed in the familiar suit of rusty brown with his feet thrust into a pair of old shoes and his head covered with a wig whose front had frequently made acquaintance with the flame of the candle in consequence of the wearers shortsightedness seemed by the eloquence of the lecturer to have been raised from the cold dark vaults of westminster to stand before us living breathing the great king samuel as of yore follow ing his career at school and at oxford we returned with him to lichfield where penniless and resourceless he married in his twentyfifth year mrs porter a lady of fortyeight years of age  very fat with swelled cheeks of a florid red produced by thick painting and increased by the liberal use of cordials was there ever such an incongruous marriage was there ever such a perfect one by a skilful turn of the kaleidoscopic handle we were transported to london and taught the secret of how to live on  a year alas  the day is past when that was possible those were indeed dark days for the poor literary hack the prey of piratical unscrupulous booksellers the patron almost gone the public not yet come no wonder that when fickle fortune consented  to bestow a momentary glance of pity on the struggling writer joy obtained the mastery over prudence and he plunged into the vortex of dissipation and prodigality with appalling recklessness the picture of poor boyse writing in bed because he had no clothes to wear with his arms thrust through two holes in the blanket and spending his final sixpence to buy ¢vuffes with which to toll down the   la societe francaisemonday october  chairman mr s j tungay business readings and recita tions the following took part mr bailey gave l homme timide mr l j graveline le crepaud mr h

section next week  un peu histoire musicale a paper by mr henri sage  j e maycock hon sec \f  the polytechnic magazine  october          last of his beef is not an isolated or exaggerated one but johnson rising like a newborn sun was destined to dispel this night of literary slavery his fist levelled the bookseller in the dust while his letter to lord chesterfield announced to the world that the patron had been hurled from his throne and that the republic of letters had commenced with his little idiosyncrasies his disregard of etiquette and the laws of society the world is familiar but these foibles sink and fade away in the contemplation of his deeds of mercy his house the mecca of light and learning was also the asylum of the poor and the distressed a blind and peevish old lady a troublesome negro a broken down doctor as well as the outcast and the desolate all found a refuge and peace within its hospitable portals  and so in the matchless flow of the lecturers eloquence we lived through the scenes of johnsons life until we came to the last scene of all when overcoming the haunting fears of death and fortified with a simple childlike trust in the supreme being to whose service his life had been dedicated the great king samuel laid aside his earthly crown worn with so much suffering but with an unrivalled majesty leaving behind him a record and an example it would be well for us to emulate  next week mr durrant will give us a lecture on  the uses of biography and the remainder of the evening will be devoted to a discussion on the lecture and to business matters connected with the circle the reading for the week is the whole of the introduction and up to page  of the text members are re minded that monthly programmes will be posted up on the notice boards to

goals for to one against the poly had almost the same team as last week with the exception of harry wilkinson who has just returned from his holidays barnet won the toss and took advantage of the hill but poly were first to press hopper making a fine run down on the left and passing to the centre but dobson was unable to get there as he had been badly kicked in the first minute of the game so a grand opportunity was lost play was chiefly on the right wing where janes who created such an impression in the middlesex trial match on wednesday last was giving campion and harry wilkinson a deal of trouble he being very tricky fast and a dead shot at goal it was one of janes centres that enabled prince to beat bunkum which was quickly followed by another from langley  and just before halftime prince obtained a third the poly crossing over with three goals against them to love the second half the poly had the ad vantage of the hill and were not long in finding an opening  and it was one of tindalls fine centres that enabled jelpke to score the polys first goal a most deter mined attack was kept up by the homesters but the polys defence was very good hogg and hoare especially distin guishing themselves as in the first half most of the play was on the right wing barnet simply starving their left who looked anything but pleased at the ill fare provided for them jones now broke away

going at a great rate into the lefthand top corner of the net it was by far the most brilliant singlehanded effort of the afternoon the poly ought to have scored again but were weak in front of goal with the exception of hopper and tindall who played a grand game at the call of time the result was barnet four poly two the winners played with great dash backed up with a good deal of force the poly

this week i am obliged to hold over the following club reports  rugby football chess and draughts old quintinian football and ramblers they shall appear next week meantime now that we are in the winter season i must ask all contri butors to be witty if possible but brief certainlyep pm \f the  polytechnic  magazine october                         no mr c b cant   faith doth not lie dead in the breast but is lovely and fruitful in bringing forth good workscranmer  now i dont mind letting you know quite confidentially that im getting into a bit of a difficulty in these weekly notes for want of another superlative or two i never read what ive written in past weeks  not merely because it belongs to the limbo of the past and we belong to the present but because of a vague kind of a fear that i am describing my subject each week as the most energetic being in our world no please dont look back and check me just let me say the same thing again this week and ill go through all my dictionaries and lindley murrays in quest of the missing degree ere another short week has brought its life and adventures along for description  charles brown cant came up to the metropolis from hert fordshire six years ago and fortunately for us and for him self he drifted to west london and soon gravitated towards the poly the first week or two was spent as far too many are spent by our new members in wandering round the gym gallery with his hands in his pockets he tells me though this latter detail is just a bit too too and i fancy charleys memory must have gone astray who ever saw him with his hands in his pockets well after a week or so will roome got hold of him  he joined mrs quintin hoggs thursday evening class made the acquaintance of ben davies fred harman charlie edwards and co and became a poly boy  with these new friends came a new life a life bursting with a desire to do something in the work he had taken up he helped fred harman in connection with the christian en deavour society he became hon sec of the openair branch of the poly mission and last year he joined the committee of the holidaybyproxy fund in all these matters charley cant is like a pea on a drum he is never still  and i should like the many readers of the poly mac to see the quantity of matter i get from him occasionally and whichifrequently and almost tearfully have to crowd out possibly this will surprise many who read these notes and who will make his acquaintance for the first time through the portrait above the reason is that he is rarely to be seen about the institute unemployed  he always has some work on hand in his own sphere which keeps him busy though generally not among the crowds of the social or reading room i may explain in passing that  had some difficulty with him as i am having with others in obtaining his permission to be included in this series  but i pointed out to     him as i am pointing out to all that the main object of these notes is te introduce the workers of our many sections to the institute generally so that readers may have a more definite idea of the work and workers around them when at the poly charley cants usual haunt is room an uncomfortable chamber far away up near the roof which is made cheerful only by the light hearts of those who nightly assemble there this is the bureau in which the business of the poly christian mission is arranged and here charley cant is known and esteemed as an enthusiastic member of the executive the outdoor services held during the summer months are his delight week after week while the weather and light permit these meetings have been held with charley cant as one of the busiest workers though of course i must not in justice to the other good fellows fail to remember the time and interest which so many of them put into the work  charley cants strong point is missionary effort he feels that the nature of the work requires a constantly energetic policy  one must be ever moving forward and endeavouring to take others along too it is in this spirit he takes up the outdoor services and promotes the work of the christian endeavour society in connection with which most of us will remember we at the polytechnic are helping to maintain a mis sionary in the new hebrides islands of course charley cant has a hobbyfew energetic men are without themand he is always urging the desirability of establishing a poly mission hall the cyclists and harriers have their club rooms  the cricketers and the footballers have merton hall and the parlia ment hasthe great hall says he  what he wants isahall which can be constantly used in the work upon which he is engaged situated as we are in the west end of londonthe wicked west as he calls itwe are directed by the homely old maxim  charity begins at home to push our work as much as possible in our immediate neighbourhood and with this in view he is strongly in favour of a suggestion which mr paton threw out at our jubilee service a month or two since that there should be a poly settlement somewhat on the lines of the university settlements that have been founded in the east endof london probably to urge this effectually charley and his friends will have to wait a while till they have become stronger in numbers it cannot come within the region of practicability till the yeast of their advocacy has permeated a far larger circle  but time is on their side if a great thing can be done at all says ruskin it can be done easily but it is in that kind of ease with which a tree blossoms after long years of gathering strength     next week mr w s ingmere poly harriers     poly cycling club  we ran last saturday to ripley this always proves a favourite run so that we were not surprised to see such a large crowd turn out neither were we surprised to find that after passing ditton our fellows were anxious to indulge in a bit of fast pedalling the best part of the run was however the moonlight run home  it seems that we have not even yet finished meddling with the records for last thursday at the crystal palace nelson of ours with his friend james succeeded in altering worlds tandem records from eleven to fifty miles inclusive and also worlds records for all types of machines from thirtyfour to fifty miles inclusive having been fortunate in securing good pacing they covered  miles  yards in the first halfhour and  miles  yards in the hour beating the previous record held by mcgregor and nelson by  yards at the end of the fifty miles they were i min   secs inside worlds tandem record and   secs inside walterss safety record     i am pleased to state that we have been able after all to secure the large hall at the red lion at barnet for our closing run and also for the photo on the day following  and i therefore trust that you will make a special note of the date the  which is the last saturday in the monthand re member that we shall turn up wet or fine and that we are going all out in the concert line  tickets for the dinner on november  will be ready at the end of the week and will be for sale in our clubroom  the run on saturday will be from the square at  as usual f g mines turnbull asst hon sec    \foctober    the polythchnic magazine             wlouldst thou    wilt thou be made wholejohn v   ir has been remarked that all the most precious things of life are the common things the fresh air the bright sunshine the invigorating breeze these can never be made the subject of any corner or the monopoly of any trust they are gods free gifts to his children who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust as a counterpart to this it has often struck me that the really great things of life can always be described in short terse saxon words the long sevensyllable abominations which horace laughed at  years ago and which today are largely made in germany may find their place appropriately enough in a dictionary and may lend themselves to all sorts of ingenuous dissections by the scalpel of the philological expert but are never necessary to express the real root thoughts of our race love joy peace hope life home god these are all short simple words a child can understand them and the wisest man living cannot begin to exhaust their meaning  now i have given you this afternoon two simple words wilt thou as it stands in the authorised version  wouldst thou as it stands in the revised version plain words with a plain meaning and before we consider them i would have you remark that great words have a knack of becoming greater when used by a great man he puts a depth into them or perhaps i ought to say reveals a depth in them which we never guessed at before i do not propose to dwell much on the details of the story i have read to you but rather to con centrate our attention on the two words which i have empha sised  you know the story well enough  there was a pool called bethesda the place of five porches in jerusalem which was supposed to have miraculous properties owing to its being connected with some underground fissure through which gas occasionally escaped into the water bethesda itself has i believe been recently unearthed a porch stood on each side of the pool and the fifth porch or arch spanned the pool itself the legend was that whosoever first stepped into the water after the gas or the socalled angel had troubled it would be healed of whatsoever disease he had faith and credulity can do much and in nervous diseases i do not doubt that much good was often derived from the effort made to take the plunge and the moral effect of the faith in which it was done at the time our lord visited the pool the place was crowded with the sick and the deformed many of them accompanied by friends to help them into the water as soon as it had been troubled but amongst them was lying one poor man who for thirtyeight years had been crippled and who was in such a sad case that he had no friend to help him into the healing pool on this particular day with which we are dealing however there came one who could see something more in the sufferer than the mere outward deformity he knew how long the thirtyeight years had seemed he knew the helpless condition of the poor man and leoking into his face asked him  wouldst thou  that is to say  do you really desire to be made whole the lord looketh on the heart says the old book and christs question was no surface one he went down into the depths of the mans nature  do you think dear fellows that in gods sight moral deformity is not as hideous and loathsome a thing as physical deformity is with us may not the meaning of our lords words that  whatsoever is whispered in the ear shall be proclaimed upon the housetop mean that mans secret sins shall mar and distort his spiritual body just as wounds and accidents do our physical body so that beyond the grave all the world may read written on our spiritual bodies the story of our life do you not think that if the christ were here this afternoon as i believe he is ever with those who really seek him he would look into your face and say charlie arthur will  wouldst ¢zou be made whole in the sight of god my boy what answer would you give do you really desire to be free from your besetting sin can you really take into your lips the beautiful words of the english last supper service and say of your sins that the remembrance of them is grievous the burden intolerable no such man ever sought salvation in vain the trouble is not that god will not heal us but that we will not be healed and  want you this afternoon to consider with me your answer to christs question  woudst thou wouldst chou  in the long run aman is what he desires to be  i think   notes of an address delivered on sunday afternoon no claint is made for originality or literary merit in these notes in preparing these addresses for delivery i made use of any books i possess on the subject in hand and my time does not allow of that careful revision almost amounting to rewriting which should pre cede the publication of extempore addressesq h                    your experience of life will already have told you that if a man seeks any one thing so earnestly that he is willing to sacrifice everything else so that he may gain his object he will in nearly every case attain to some extent that which he desires the man who is ready to eat the bread of carefulness to deny   himself pleasure to work early and late in order that he may  accumulate money generally succeeds in gathering together a certain number of those metal discs which are so useless unless well spent the man who is willing to burn the students lamp to work early and late at his books will in the long run acquire the knowledge he seeks the man who entering the army seeks to be not an idler but a real soldier attains his desire unless his life be cut short by a bullet and so aman who puts the pursuit of good and being goad above all else has never far to took for the strong arm of god to help him and the loving voice of god to cheer him think how different gods estimates of a man are from the poor and shallow estimate formed by us when a man dies one asks what he died worth and the answer is generally expressed in so many pounds shillings and pence the very things that a man cannot take with him beyond the grave while the weightier questions of judgment and righteousness are left out yet my boy what a man dies worth may be summed up in his character and nothing else the millions of a rothschild can not save a man who has lived a selfish life from dying a pauper while from the humblest home in london a soul may go forth rich in all that finds currency in the royal treasury of heaven there was a man we are told of in the bible a wise cultivator a good farmer a prudent man his rieighbours thought him wealthy and intelligent and in the cultivation of his farm so he was  but in the cultivation of his own character he is written down fool for his barns were all filled with what he could not take with him and the cry of his disregarded conscience and uncaredfor moral nature went up to the judgment seat of god failure and success are not bounded by our earthly horizon and indeed we ourselves often recognise this  for the heretics of yesterday are the saints of today it is not only the jews who built the tombs of the prophets of previous generations while they crucified the greatest of all prophets who lived in their own  not all who seem to fail have failed indeed   not all who fail have therefore worked in vain   there is no failure for the good and wise   and though thy seed should fall by the wayside  and the birds snatch ityet the birds are fed  or they may bear it far across the tide to give rich harvests after thou art dead  the man whom christ declared to be the peer of any who had been born of woman was beheaded in prison by the order of a drunken king paul in prison at rome moaned out at the end of his missionary life that all the churches in asia which he had founded with his hearts blood had turned from him and pauls great master may well have been deemeda failure as he hung on the cross of shame having come unto his own and his own received him not yet today we see that it was pauls life and mission work which saved theearly christian church from the trammels of judaism and fitted it for the gentile world whilechrist has revolutionised the human conceptions of right and wrong more than any being who ever lived and has opened up visions of god and possibilities of communion with him which disclose fresh vistas of sonship to each generation i thank god that all this is so not one of us who has tried to do right and failed but can find some comfort in the thought that god sees not only what we are but what we would be he marks our deeds it is true and we must give an account to him of the things done in the body he marks our speech and even our idle words must be accounted for to him but beyond all this he sees our thoughts he knows whether we have crowned evil in our minds as our god and our chief object or whether we would be made whole and that the evil we do and the slips we make distress us and bring tears of penitence to our eyes scarcely less bitter than the sorrow it awakes in his own soul lowell has beautifully put the power of desire in a poem which you ought all to know by heart    of all the myriad moods of mind which through our soul come thronging surely there is none so good and kind so beautiful as longing  the thing we long for that we are for one transcendent moment before the present poor and bare comes with its sneering comment \f  the polytechnic magazine  october          through all our petty stir and strife  shines down the great ideal  and longing moulds in clay what life carves in the marble real  to let the new life in we know desire must ope the portal   and perhaps the longing to be so helps make the soul immortal   longing is gods fresh heavenly will   with our poor earthward striving  we quench it that we may be still content with merely living  but would we know that hearts full scope which we are daily wronging  our lives must climb from hope to hope and realise our longing   oh let us hope that to our praise  good god not only reckons  the moments when we tread his ways but when his spirit beckons   that some slight good is also wrought beyond selfsatisfaction  when we are merely good in thought howeer we fail in action  thank goa that he sees the desires deep down in our souls that he nourishes the seed which he has planted and to as many as receive him to them he gives power to become the sons of god have you noticed how very often christs answer to those who sought his help was be it unto thee even as thou wilt the willing heart had as it were to let in the power of the christ is it not so today can heaven break down your will when you cling to your sin can god redeem vou from that which you love better than him better than righteousness what answer do your hearts  give this afternoon wouldst thou would i be made whole do i really want to be delivered from the power of evil do i really want never again to  indulge this sin can the divine eyes see in my inmost soul the cry of a prisoner longing for freedom the eagerness of lot fleeing from sodom be it unto thee even as thou wilt al though this is a condition of redemption it is not the limit of gods goodness he gives when we ask but he pives us much more we never asked him for the incarnation for the in dwelling spirit for the cross of calvary for the morn of easter  but our father knew that we had need of these things alas we may neutralise and sterilise the striving of gods spirit within us if our wills are in rebellion to him tennyson sings   our wills are ours we know not why   our wills are ours to make them thine  i have said that god does not limit his conception of failure and success by our human horizon and it is equally true that he does not count attainment everything paul had not attained to more than the outskirts of his desires and you andiare beyond measure behind him turn for a moment if you will to the beatitudes perhaps the best known of christs words of blessing let us open them and see what we can claim blessed are the meek thoughts of pride self seeking uncharitableness crowd in our minds and we say with a sigh  there is no place here for me if it is limited to those who are meek  we go on to the next  blessed are the merciful there too our conscience rises up in judgment against us and condemns us and makes the prayer  forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors falter on our lips  blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake but we have borne no cross and undergone no persecution and know not whether our faith would stand the test that tried the martyrs of old  blessed are the pure in heart which of us can stand that test in the white light of gods throne we dare not open up all the thoughts of our hearts to our best friend how much less to him we cry in despair  hast thou not kept a blessing for me also oh my father yes here is one  blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled my boy it may be that you know you have failed in aeekness in purity or mercy and courage yet at least there may be in your soul a desire to be redeemed from your lower nature  at least you may be able to look into the face of christ and say to him  yea lord thou knowest all things     thou knowest that i love thee  thou knowest that i would                 be made whole the very desire is the sign of some life left a slight desire it may be  an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light  and with no language but a cry   but still there is the cryand he who heard the cry of the lad  in the wilderness long ago will provide the needful for you as he did for ishmael and hagar you have not yet turned your backs upon the healing christ do you remember that scene which we looked upon during our peter series last winter it was on the evening following that on which he had fed five thousand he had been teaching in the synagogue at caper naum and his words had offended the ears of those who listened  and as the sun set behind the hills of galilee it showed all those multitudes who had crowded to hear him in the morning leaving him discontented and alienated in the evening only a little knot of his own followers remained with him and christ turn ing to them with a sigh asked each as the revised version has it wouldst thou also go away to one at least who heard that question it might have been salvation to have gone judas stayed but stayed to betray his lord be honest with yourself this afternoon have you begun to find your religion irksome your prayer neglected your religious duties tiresome have you lost the enthusiasm you once had and have you almost wished that gods spirit had never stirred high desires in your soul or that you could drown his voice and sin as you would  what answer could you give to the wouldst thou of the christ dealing with him who seeth the heart he judges not by the lip reply or the formalism of your worship but by the hearts desire which no other eye can see are you conscious that judged by your life thou wouldst not be healed of your sin you would if you dared goaway my boy you may go the kingdom of heaven is forced upon none the jewel of purity can only shine on him who chooses it and voluntarily takes off the gewgaws of his besetting sin yes you may go but remember that hot tears will be wept for you the eternal heartif we may say it with reverencewill look after you as it did after his prodigal boy a prodigal who comes not home  and now dear fellows for the last thought i will try and give you this afternoon this question  wouldst thou or do you desire it though it may well be asked of us can never be asked by us to the eternal father yet when christ was on earth it was just this very question that men were perpetually putting to him  thou wilt said the leper  thou canst make me clean  f you can do anything said the father of the lunatic boy help us christ gently put these ifs in the right place the question is not he said if i desire to heal but if you desire to be healed the doubt is not whether the divine forgiveness is willing to flow into your soul but whether you are willing to open the sinbarred door to take him for your lord there never was any reluctance in gods heart to save you there is none this afternoon the prodigal thought he had to overcome some unwillingness for he went with the prayer  make me one of thine hired servants ay he must do some scrubbing and polishing and bootblacking to overcome the unwillingness in his fathers heart to save him you will remember the gracious response  my son myson the boys place had always been empty the boys absence had always been felt the son had always been missed there is joy in the presence of the anyels of god over one sinner that repenteth   wouldst thou be healed this afternoon and if so why  is it a fear of hell and vengeance that is driving you to god or is it the desire that your life may be beautiful and healthful and truethat out of your heart may go healing streams that you may give even as to you it has abundantly been given if so you may well rest assured of your reception the spirit of sonship is already wuthin you and the name of child is trembling on the fathers lips better this surely than you should make your religion into a kind of fetish which you fondly deem shall enable you to sin without suffering to do evil and escape the whipping   who seeks for heaven alone to save his soul may keep the path but will not reach the zoal  while he who walks in love may wander far yet god will bring him where the blessed are  oh my boys on this first sunday afternoon of our session let us pray god to make us real for you there is a place in the many mansions for you the kiss of welcome the palm branch of victory the song of the redeemed at the round table of gods elect there is a place for every knightly soul who \fcetober    the polytechnic magazine          goes out to battle for his kingdom  yet remember that place may be empty that kiss may be ungiven that song unsung but it will be our doing not his for he willeth not that any should perish what shall your hearts answer be this after noon will you surrender your sin or give up your christ would you be made whole wouldstthou wouldst hou   joy is a dutyso with golden lore the hebrew rabbis taught in days of yore  and happy human hearts heard in their speech almost the highest wisdom man could reach  but one bright peak still rises far above and there the master stands whose name is love saying to those whom heavy tasks employ  life is divine when duty is a joy  polptecbuic parliament  wednesday last saw the opening of our eighteenth session and there is every reason to suppose that during the course of the next six months the reputation of the parliament will not only be sustained but increased and its influence extended  as is usual on the first night of a session the business was principally formal consisting for the greater part of the election        of officers the following were the successful nominations  president  mr quintin hogc speaker mr a bockett chatrmanof committees mr h samson clark treasurer   mr d j s reexs serjeantat arms mr a westland clerk assistant  mr buckland  clerk of the house representatives on the in stitule council messrs clark and rees  the most interesting feature of the evening was the distribu tion of the oratory medals by the president mr p b morle and mr f v fisher being the recipients of the gold and silver medals respectively mr hogg in the course of a few wellchosen remarks dwelt upon the benefits accruing from debating societies in general and the poly parliament in par ticular and expressed the hope that the ensuing session would be thoroughly successful  in the absence of the speaker the opening address to mem bers was delivered by the chairman  the house then proceeded to the orders of the day and mr purchase the newlyelected leader made his début as premier by introducing the ministerial statement of the liberal government his remarks being denunciatory of the conduct of foreign affairs by her majestys government who he con tended had huinihated this country in the eyes of the world mr p b morle leader of the opposition moved the adjourn ment of the debate and the house adjourned at ten oclock  a w thomas clerk of the house  liberal parry novresthe session of  has now commenced in earnest and members are reminded that the success of the party and indeed of the house generally can only be assured by their attending the debates regularly old members wishing to introduce friends are requested to do so as early as possible for it is far easier for a new man to gain a footing in the house early in the session than later on when members have jearned to discriminate between old and young debaters and sometimes the newcomers suffer by the comparison at the beginning of the session however the distinction is not nearly so noticeable so we trust all our members will make a point of introducing as much fresh blood as possible at the present moment last wednesday promised most encouragingly for the success of the present session the house being comfortably filled and members were evidently quite determined to prove by their energy and persistence that they were very much alive things got quite cheery once or twice and our new leader mr purchase made a very successful opening in the new position it has been arranged to hold a social conversazione of the party about the middle part of november and i should feel obliged if any gentlemen who are the happy possessors of good voices will kindly communicate with mr allen yell who will have all the arrangements in hand mr yell would also like to hear from one or two instrumentalists and if any member can introduce him toa lightning caricaturist or somebody with a gifted nature out of the ordinary in the way of entertainments he would earn yells lasting gratitude  offered him my own services but he says i give him enough entertainment on wednesdays he muttered something about talking fireworks what does he mean  a l h mcmaster  mr a w thomas        the

hon see   rr  the reading circle  friday last being the first day in the circle year mr durrant held a reception of the members in the marlborough room the feature of the evening was an introductory lecture on  dr johnson and the wits of his time by mr denison allport plunging at once into the subject with a vigour so characteristic of the lecturer we were treated to a very fine word portrait of the sage of bolt court who dressed in the familiar suit of rusty brown with his feet thrust into a pair of old shoes and his head covered with a wig whose front had frequently made acquaintance with the flame of the candle in consequence of the wearers shortsightedness seemed by the eloquence of the lecturer to have been raised from the cold dark vaults of westminster to stand before us living breathing the great king samuel as of yore follow ing his career at school and at oxford we returned with him to lichfield where penniless and resourceless he married in his twentyfifth year mrs porter a lady of fortyeight years of age  very fat with swelled cheeks of a florid red produced by thick painting and increased by the liberal use of cordials was there ever such an incongruous marriage was there ever such a perfect one by a skilful turn of the kaleidoscopic handle we were transported to london and taught the secret of how to live on  a year alas  the day is past when that was possible those were indeed dark days for the poor literary hack the prey of piratical unscrupulous booksellers the patron almost gone the public not yet come no wonder that when fickle fortune consented  to bestow a momentary glance of pity on the struggling writer joy obtained the mastery over prudence and he plunged into the vortex of dissipation and prodigality with appalling recklessness the picture of poor boyse writing in bed because he had no clothes to wear with his arms thrust through two holes in the blanket and spending his final sixpence to buy ¢vuffes with which to toll down the   la societe francaisemonday october  chairman mr s j tungay business readings and recita tions the following took part mr bailey gave l homme timide mr l j graveline le crepaud mr h

section next week  un peu histoire musicale a paper by mr henri sage  j e maycock hon sec \f  the polytechnic magazine  october          last of his beef is not an isolated or exaggerated one but johnson rising like a newborn sun was destined to dispel this night of literary slavery his fist levelled the bookseller in the dust while his letter to lord chesterfield announced to the world that the patron had been hurled from his throne and that the republic of letters had commenced with his little idiosyncrasies his disregard of etiquette and the laws of society the world is familiar but these foibles sink and fade away in the contemplation of his deeds of mercy his house the mecca of light and learning was also the asylum of the poor and the distressed a blind and peevish old lady a troublesome negro a broken down doctor as well as the outcast and the desolate all found a refuge and peace within its hospitable portals  and so in the matchless flow of the lecturers eloquence we lived through the scenes of johnsons life until we came to the last scene of all when overcoming the haunting fears of death and fortified with a simple childlike trust in the supreme being to whose service his life had been dedicated the great king samuel laid aside his earthly crown worn with so much suffering but with an unrivalled majesty leaving behind him a record and an example it would be well for us to emulate  next week mr durrant will give us a lecture on  the uses of biography and the remainder of the evening will be devoted to a discussion on the lecture and to business matters connected with the circle the reading for the week is the whole of the introduction and up to page  of the text members are re minded that monthly programmes will be posted up on the notice boards to

goals for to one against the poly had almost the same team as last week with the exception of harry wilkinson who has just returned from his holidays barnet won the toss and took advantage of the hill but poly were first to press hopper making a fine run down on the left and passing to the centre but dobson was unable to get there as he had been badly kicked in the first minute of the game so a grand opportunity was lost play was chiefly on the right wing where janes who created such an impression in the middlesex trial match on wednesday last was giving campion and harry wilkinson a deal of trouble he being very tricky fast and a dead shot at goal it was one of janes centres that enabled prince to beat bunkum which was quickly followed by another from langley  and just before halftime prince obtained a third the poly crossing over with three goals against them to love the second half the poly had the ad vantage of the hill and were not long in finding an opening  and it was one of tindalls fine centres that enabled jelpke to score the polys first goal a most deter mined attack was kept up by the homesters but the polys defence was very good hogg and hoare especially distin guishing themselves as in the first half most of the play was on the right wing barnet simply starving their left who looked anything but pleased at the ill fare provided for them jones now broke away and centering well enabled arundel to score for barnet bert tindall then quite electrified the crowd and barnets defence by making a splendid run down and winding up with a magnificent shot the ball going at a great rate into the lefthand top corner of the net it was by far the most brilliant singlehanded effort of the afternoon the poly ought to have scored again but were weak in front of goal with the exception of hopper and tindall who played a grand game at the call of time the result was barnet four poly two the winners played with great dash backed up with a good deal of force the poly

winter season i must ask all contri butors to be witty if possible but brief certainlyep pm \f the  polytechnic  magazine october                         no mr c b cant   faith doth not lie dead in the breast but is lovely and fruitful in bringing forth good workscranmer  now i dont mind letting you know quite confidentially that im getting into a bit of a difficulty in these weekly notes for want of another superlative or two i never read what ive written in past weeks  not merely because it belongs to the limbo of the past and we belong to the present but because of a vague kind of a fear that i am describing my subject each week as the most energetic being in our world no please dont look back and check me just let me say the same thing again this week and ill go through all my dictionaries and lindley murrays in quest of the missing degree ere another short week has brought its life and adventures along for description  charles brown cant came up to the metropolis from hert fordshire six years ago and fortunately for us and for him self he drifted to west london and soon gravitated towards the poly the first week or two was spent as far too many are spent by our new members in wandering round the gym gallery with his hands in his pockets he tells me though this latter detail is just a bit too too and i fancy charleys memory must have gone astray who ever saw him with his hands in his pockets well after a week or so will roome got hold of him  he joined mrs quintin hoggs thursday evening class made the acquaintance of ben davies fred harman charlie edwards and co and became a poly boy  with these new friends came a new life a life bursting with a desire to do something in the work he had taken up he helped fred harman in connection with the christian en deavour society he became hon sec of the openair branch of the poly mission and last year he joined the committee of the holidaybyproxy fund in all these matters charley cant is like a pea on a drum he is never still  and i should like the many readers of the poly mac to see the quantity of matter i get from him occasionally and whichifrequently and almost tearfully have to crowd out possibly this will surprise many who read these notes and who will make his acquaintance for the first time through the portrait above the reason is that he is rarely to be seen about the institute unemployed  he always has some work on hand in his own sphere which keeps him busy though generally not among the crowds of the social or reading room i may explain in passing that  had some difficulty with him as i am having with others in obtaining his permission to be included in this series  but i pointed out to     him as i am pointing out to all that the main object of these notes is te introduce the workers of our many sections to the institute generally so that readers may have a more definite idea of the work and workers around them when at the poly charley cants usual haunt is room an uncomfortable chamber far away up near the roof which is made cheerful only by the light hearts of those who nightly assemble there this is the bureau in which the business of the poly christian mission is arranged and here charley cant is known and esteemed as an enthusiastic member of the executive the outdoor services held during the summer months are his delight week after week while the weather and light permit these meetings have been held with charley cant as one of the busiest workers though of course i must not in justice to the other good fellows fail to remember the time and interest which so many of them put into the work  charley cants strong point is missionary effort he feels that the nature of the work requires a constantly energetic policy  one must be ever moving forward and endeavouring to take others along too it is in this spirit he takes up the outdoor services and promotes the work of the christian endeavour society in connection with which most of us will remember we at the polytechnic are helping to maintain a mis sionary in the new hebrides islands of course charley cant has a hobbyfew energetic men are without themand he is always urging the desirability of establishing a poly mission hall the cyclists and harriers have their club rooms  the cricketers and the footballers have merton hall and the parlia ment hasthe great hall says he  what he wants isahall which can be constantly used in the work upon which he is engaged situated as we are in the west end of londonthe wicked west as he calls itwe are directed by the homely old maxim  charity begins at home to push our work as much as possible in our immediate neighbourhood and with this in view he is strongly in favour of a suggestion which mr paton threw out at our jubilee service a month or two since that there should be a poly settlement somewhat on the lines of the university settlements that have been founded in the east endof london probably to urge this effectually charley and his friends will have to wait a while till they have become stronger in numbers it cannot come within the region of practicability till the yeast of their advocacy has permeated a far larger circle  but time is on their side if a great thing can be done at all says ruskin it can be done easily but it is in that kind of ease with which a tree blossoms after long years of gathering strength     next week mr w s ingmere poly harriers     poly cycling club  we ran last saturday to ripley this always proves a favourite run so that we were not surprised to see such a large crowd turn out neither were we surprised to find that after passing ditton our fellows were anxious to indulge in a bit of fast pedalling the best part of the run was however the moonlight run home  it seems that we have not even yet finished meddling with the records for last thursday at the crystal palace nelson of ours with his friend james succeeded in altering worlds tandem records from eleven to fifty miles inclusive and also worlds records for all types of machines from thirtyfour to fifty miles inclusive having been fortunate in securing good pacing they covered  miles  yards in the first halfhour and  miles  yards in the hour beating the previous record held by mcgregor and nelson by  yards at the end of the fifty miles they were i min   secs inside worlds tandem record and   secs inside walterss safety record     i am pleased to state that we have been able after all to secure the large hall at the red lion at barnet for our closing run and also for the photo on the day following  and i therefore trust that you will make a special note of the date the  which is the last saturday in the monthand re member that we shall turn up wet or fine and that we are going all out in the concert line  tickets for the dinner on november  will be ready at the end of the week and will be for sale in our clubroom  the run on saturday will be from the

precious things of life are the common things the fresh air the bright sunshine the invigorating breeze these can never be made the subject of any corner or the monopoly of any trust they are gods free gifts to his children who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust as a counterpart to this it has often struck me that the really great things of life can always be described in short terse saxon words the long sevensyllable abominations which horace laughed at  years ago and which today are largely made in germany may find their place appropriately enough in a dictionary and may lend themselves to all sorts of ingenuous dissections by the scalpel of the philological expert but are never necessary to express the real root thoughts of our race love joy peace hope life home god these are all short simple words a child can understand them and the wisest man living cannot begin to exhaust their meaning  now i have given you this afternoon two simple words wilt thou as it stands in the authorised version  wouldst thou as it stands in the revised version plain words with a plain meaning and before we consider them i would have you remark that great words have a knack of becoming greater when used by a great man he puts a depth into them or perhaps i ought to say reveals a depth in them which we never guessed at before i do not propose to dwell much on the details of the story i have read to you but rather to con centrate our attention on the two words which i have empha sised  you know the story well enough  there was a pool called bethesda the place of five porches in jerusalem which was supposed to have miraculous properties owing to its being connected with some underground fissure through which gas occasionally escaped into the water bethesda itself has i believe been recently unearthed a porch stood on each side of the pool and the fifth porch or arch spanned the pool itself the legend was that whosoever first stepped into the water after the gas or the socalled angel had troubled it would be healed of whatsoever disease he had faith and credulity can do much and in nervous diseases i do not doubt that much good was often derived from the effort made to take the plunge and the moral effect of the faith in which it was done at the time our lord visited the pool the place was crowded with the sick and the deformed many of them accompanied by friends to help them into the water as soon as it had been troubled but amongst them was lying one poor man who for thirtyeight years had been crippled and who was in such a sad case that he had no friend to help him into the healing pool on this particular day with which we are dealing however there came one who could see something more in the sufferer than the mere outward deformity he knew how long the thirtyeight years had seemed he knew the helpless condition of the poor man and leoking into his face asked him  wouldst thou  that is to say  do you really desire to be made whole the lord looketh on the heart says the old book and christs question was no surface one he went down into the depths of the mans nature  do you think dear fellows that in gods sight moral deformity is not as hideous and loathsome a thing as physical deformity is with us may not the meaning of our lords words that  whatsoever is whispered in the ear shall be proclaimed upon the housetop mean that mans secret sins shall mar and distort his spiritual body just as wounds and accidents do our physical body so that beyond the grave all the world may read written on our spiritual bodies the story of our life do you not think that if the christ were here this afternoon as i believe he is ever with those who really seek him he would look into your face and say charlie arthur will  wouldst ¢zou be made whole in the sight of god my boy what answer would you give do you really desire to be free from your besetting sin can you really take into your lips the beautiful words of the english last supper service and say of your sins that the remembrance of them is grievous the burden intolerable no such man ever sought salvation in vain the trouble is not that god will not heal us but that we will not be healed and  want you this afternoon to consider with me your answer to christs question  woudst thou wouldst chou  in the long run aman is what he desires to be  i think   notes of an address delivered on sunday afternoon no claint is made for originality or literary merit in these notes in preparing these addresses for delivery i made use of any books i possess on the subject in hand and my time does not allow of that careful revision almost amounting to rewriting which should pre cede the publication of extempore addressesq h                    your experience of life will already have told you that if a man seeks any one thing so earnestly that he is willing to sacrifice everything else so that he may gain his object he will in nearly every case attain to some extent that which he desires the man who is ready to eat the bread of carefulness to deny   himself pleasure to work early and late in order that he may  accumulate money generally succeeds in gathering together a certain number of those metal discs which are so useless unless well spent the man who is willing to burn the students lamp to work early and late at his books will in the long run acquire the knowledge he seeks the man who entering the army seeks to be not an idler but a real soldier attains his desire unless his life be cut short by a bullet and so aman who puts the pursuit of good and being goad above all else has never far to took for the strong arm of god to help him and the loving voice of god to cheer him think how different gods estimates of a man are from the poor and shallow estimate formed by us when a man dies one asks what he died worth and the answer is generally expressed in so many pounds shillings and pence the very things that a man cannot take with him beyond the grave while the weightier questions of judgment and righteousness are left out yet my boy what a man dies worth may be summed up in his character and nothing else the millions of a rothschild can not save a man who has lived a selfish life from dying a pauper while from the humblest home in london a soul may go forth rich in all that finds currency in the royal treasury of heaven there was a man we are told of in the bible a wise cultivator a good farmer a prudent man his rieighbours thought him wealthy and intelligent and in the cultivation of his farm so he was  but in the cultivation of his own character he is written down fool for his barns were all filled with what he could not take with him and the cry of his disregarded conscience and uncaredfor moral nature went up to the judgment seat of god failure and success are not bounded by our earthly horizon and indeed we ourselves often recognise this  for the heretics of yesterday are the saints of today it is not only the jews who built the tombs of the prophets of previous generations while they crucified the greatest of all prophets who lived in their own  not all who seem to fail have failed indeed   not all who fail have therefore worked in vain   there is no failure for the good and wise   and though thy seed should fall by the wayside  and the birds snatch ityet the birds are fed  or they may bear it far across the tide to give rich harvests after thou art dead  the man whom christ declared to be the peer of any who had been born of woman was beheaded in prison by the order of a drunken king paul in prison at rome moaned out at the end of his missionary life that all the churches in asia which he had founded with his hearts blood had turned from him and pauls great master may well have been deemeda failure as he hung on the cross of shame having come unto his own and his own received him not yet today we see that it was pauls life and mission work which saved theearly christian church from the trammels of judaism and fitted it for the gentile world whilechrist has revolutionised the human conceptions of right and wrong more than any being who ever lived and has opened up visions of god and possibilities of communion with him which disclose fresh vistas of sonship to each generation i thank god that all this is so not one of us who has tried to do right and failed but can find some comfort in the thought that god sees not only what we are but what we would be he marks our deeds it is true and we must give an account to him of the things done in the body he marks our speech and even our idle words must be accounted for to him but beyond all this he sees our thoughts he knows whether we have crowned evil in our minds as our god and our chief object or whether we would be made whole and that the evil we do and the slips we make distress us and bring tears of penitence to our eyes scarcely less bitter than the sorrow it awakes in his own soul lowell has beautifully put the power of desire in a poem which you ought all to know by heart    of all the myriad moods of mind which through our soul come thronging surely there is none so good and kind so beautiful as longing  the thing we long for that we are for one transcendent moment before the present poor and bare comes with its sneering comment \f  the polytechnic magazine  october          through all our petty stir and strife  shines down the great ideal  and longing moulds in clay what life carves in the marble real  to let the new life in we know desire must ope the portal   and perhaps the longing to be so helps make the soul immortal   longing is gods fresh heavenly will   with our poor earthward striving  we quench it that we may be still content with merely living  but would we know that hearts full scope which we are daily wronging  our lives must climb from hope to hope and realise our longing   oh let us hope that to our praise  good god not only reckons  the moments when we tread his ways but when his spirit beckons   that some slight good is also wrought beyond selfsatisfaction  when we are merely good in thought howeer we fail in action  thank goa that he sees the desires deep down in our souls that he nourishes the seed which he has planted and to as many as receive him to them he gives power to become the sons of god have you noticed how very often christs answer to those who sought his help was be it unto thee even as thou wilt the willing heart had as it were to let in the power of the christ is it not so today can heaven break down your will when you cling to your sin can god redeem vou from that which you love better than him better than righteousness what answer do your hearts  give this afternoon wouldst thou would i be made whole do i really want to be delivered from the power of evil do i really want never again to  indulge this sin can the divine eyes see in my inmost soul the cry of a prisoner longing for freedom the eagerness of lot fleeing from sodom be it unto thee even as thou wilt al though this is a condition of redemption it is not the limit of gods goodness he gives when we ask but he pives us much more we never asked him for the incarnation for the in dwelling spirit for the cross of calvary for the morn of easter  but our father knew that we had need of these things alas we may neutralise and sterilise the striving of gods spirit within us if our wills are in rebellion to him tennyson sings   our wills are ours we know not why   our wills are ours to make them thine  i have said that god does not limit his conception of failure and success by our human horizon and it is equally true that he does not count attainment everything paul had not attained to more than the outskirts of his desires and you andiare beyond measure behind him turn for a moment if you will to the beatitudes perhaps the best known of christs words of blessing let us open them and see what we can claim blessed are the meek thoughts of pride self seeking uncharitableness crowd in our minds and we say with a sigh  there is no place here for me if it is limited to those who are meek  we go on to the next  blessed are the merciful there too our conscience rises up in judgment against us and condemns us and makes the prayer  forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors falter on our lips  blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake but we have borne no cross and undergone no persecution and know not whether our faith would stand the test that tried the martyrs of old  blessed are the pure in heart which of us can stand that test in the white light of gods throne we dare not open up all the thoughts of our hearts to our best friend how much less to him we cry in despair  hast thou not kept a blessing for me also oh my father yes here is one  blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled my boy it may be that you know you have failed in aeekness in purity or mercy and courage yet at least there may be in your soul a desire to be redeemed from your lower nature  at least you may be able to look into the face of christ and say to him  yea lord thou knowest all things     thou knowest that i love thee  thou knowest that i would                 be made whole the very desire is the sign of some life left a slight desire it may be  an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light  and with no language but a cry   but still there is the cryand he who heard the cry of the lad  in the wilderness long ago will provide the needful for you as he did for ishmael and hagar you have not yet turned your backs upon the healing christ do you remember that scene which we looked upon during our peter series last winter it was on the evening following that on which he had fed five thousand he had been teaching in the synagogue at caper naum and his words had offended the ears of those who listened  and as the sun set behind the hills of galilee it showed all those multitudes who had crowded to hear him in the morning leaving him discontented and alienated in the evening only a little knot of his own followers remained with him and christ turn ing to them with a sigh asked each as the revised version has it wouldst thou also go away to one at least who heard that question it might have been salvation to have gone judas stayed but stayed to betray his lord be honest with yourself this afternoon have you begun to find your religion irksome your prayer neglected your religious duties tiresome have you lost the enthusiasm you once had and have you almost wished that gods spirit had never stirred high desires in your soul or that you could drown his voice and sin as you would  what answer could you give to the wouldst thou of the christ dealing with him who seeth the heart he judges not by the lip reply or the formalism of your worship but by the hearts desire which no other eye can see are you conscious that judged by your life thou wouldst not be healed of your sin you would if you dared goaway my boy you may go the kingdom of heaven is forced upon none the jewel of purity can only shine on him who chooses it and voluntarily takes off the gewgaws of his besetting sin yes you may go but remember that hot tears will be wept for you the eternal heartif we may say it with reverencewill look after you as it did after his prodigal boy a prodigal who comes not home  and now dear fellows for the last thought i will try and give you this afternoon this question  wouldst thou or do you desire it though it may well be asked of us can never be asked by us to the eternal father yet when christ was on earth it was just this very question that men were perpetually putting to him  thou wilt said the leper  thou canst make me clean  f you can do anything said the father of the lunatic boy help us christ gently put these ifs in the right place the question is not he said if i desire to heal but if you desire to be healed the doubt is not whether the divine forgiveness is willing to flow into your soul but whether you are willing to open the sinbarred door to take him for your lord there never was any reluctance in gods heart to save you there is none this afternoon the prodigal thought he had to overcome some unwillingness for he went with the prayer  make me one of thine hired servants ay he must do some scrubbing and polishing and bootblacking to overcome the unwillingness in his fathers heart to save him you will remember the gracious response  my son myson the boys place had always been empty the boys absence had always been felt the son had always been missed there is joy in the presence of the anyels of god over one sinner that repenteth   wouldst thou be healed this afternoon and if so why  is it a fear of hell and vengeance that is driving you to god or is it the desire that your life may be beautiful and healthful and truethat out of your heart may go healing streams that you may give even as to you it has abundantly been given if so you may well rest assured of your reception the spirit of sonship is already wuthin you and the name of child is trembling on the fathers lips better this surely than you should make your religion into a kind of fetish which you fondly deem shall enable you to sin without suffering to do evil and escape the whipping   who seeks for heaven alone to save his soul may keep the path but will not reach the zoal  while he who walks in love may wander far yet god will bring him where the blessed are  oh my boys on this first sunday afternoon of our session let us pray god to make us real for you there is a place in the many mansions for you the kiss of welcome the palm branch of victory the song of the redeemed at the round table of gods elect there is a place for every knightly soul who \fcetober    the polytechnic magazine          goes out to battle for his kingdom  yet remember that place may be empty that kiss may be ungiven that song unsung but it will be our doing not his for he willeth not that any should perish what shall your hearts answer be this after noon will you surrender your sin or give up your christ would you be made whole wouldstthou wouldst hou   joy is a dutyso with golden lore the hebrew rabbis taught in days of yore  and happy human hearts heard in their speech almost the highest wisdom man could reach  but one bright peak still rises far above and there the master stands whose name is love saying to those whom heavy tasks employ  life is divine when duty is a joy  polptecbuic parliament  wednesday last saw the opening of our eighteenth session and there is every reason to suppose that during the course of the next six months the reputation of the parliament will not only be sustained but increased and its influence extended  as is usual on the first night of a session the business was principally formal consisting for the greater part of the election        of officers the following were the successful nominations  president  mr quintin hogc speaker mr a bockett chatrmanof committees mr h samson clark treasurer   mr d j s reexs serjeantat arms mr a westland clerk assistant  mr buckland  clerk of the house representatives on the in stitule council messrs clark and rees  the most interesting feature of the evening was the distribu tion of the oratory medals by the president mr p b morle and mr f v fisher being the recipients of the gold and silver medals respectively mr hogg in the course of a few wellchosen remarks dwelt upon the benefits accruing from debating societies in general and the poly parliament in par ticular and expressed the hope that the ensuing session would be thoroughly successful  in the absence of the speaker the opening address to mem bers was delivered by the chairman  the house then proceeded to the orders of the day and mr purchase the newlyelected leader made his début as premier by introducing the ministerial statement of the liberal government his remarks being denunciatory of the conduct of foreign affairs by her majestys government who he con tended had huinihated this country in the eyes of the world mr p b morle leader of the opposition moved the adjourn ment of the debate and the house adjourned at ten oclock  a w thomas clerk of the house  liberal parry novresthe session of  has now commenced in earnest and members are reminded that the success of the party and indeed of the house generally can only be assured by their attending the debates regularly old members wishing to introduce friends are requested to do so as early as possible for it is far easier for a new man to gain a footing in the house early in the session than later on when members have jearned to discriminate between old and young debaters and sometimes the newcomers suffer by the comparison at the beginning of the session however the distinction is not nearly so noticeable so we trust all our members will make a point of introducing as much fresh blood as possible at the present moment last wednesday promised most encouragingly for the success of the present session the house being comfortably filled and members were evidently quite determined to prove by their energy and persistence that they were very much alive things got quite cheery once or twice and our new leader mr purchase made a very successful opening in the new position it has been arranged to hold a social conversazione of the party about the middle part of november and i should feel obliged if any gentlemen who are the happy possessors of good voices will kindly communicate with mr allen yell who will have all the arrangements in hand mr yell would also like to hear from one or two instrumentalists and if any member can introduce him toa lightning caricaturist or somebody with a gifted nature out of the ordinary in the way of entertainments he would earn yells lasting gratitude  offered him my own services but he says i give him enough entertainment on wednesdays he muttered something about talking fireworks what does he mean  a l h mcmaster  mr a w thomas        the
