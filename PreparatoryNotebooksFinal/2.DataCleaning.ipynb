with a friend under the style of morrelland painter at  kentish town road where he has opened a stationery bookselling and bookbinding business he would be glad of the custom of any of our members who would like to do a good turn to an old poly boy     our wet bobs seem to have had a good time on christmas eve their race  being followed by a supper and concert   at lea rayners new house i hear they intend giving a grand evening concert in the marlborough rooms on wednesday january  and judging by the hardy way in which they carry on their sport in every kind of weather no doubt they will score another success     final notice  an announcement as subjoined has appeared in the afagazrne for the past fortnight and this merely serves to remind members for the last time that copies may be ordered at the reduced rates up to and including saturday december  after which date full rates will be charged the  portrait gallery will be a really handsome memento of the polytechnic and one which will well deserve preservation it will be observed that i have in response to request arranged to bind a few copies in a more expensive style but it must be understood that these can only be supplied to order requisitions should be sent in to the office of this paper  langhamplace w  uwnetqu e  vide glossary polytechnic words and phrases will be published shortly  the poly portrait gallery

case of the cloth copies   and  respectively as the number printed will be strictly limited oruers should be sent in at once     a meeting of the polytechnic sketch ing club was held in the life room polytechnic school of art on thursday december  the exhibits were on the whole remarkably good and most useful criticism was given by mr s j solomons ra the keynote of his remarks was  composition and it is to be hoped that the members will take the advice so kindly tendered that they should attempt compositions preferably in black and white in which two or more figures are placed in relationship to one another the criticism was followed throughout with marked attention by a crowded room and the proceedings terminated with a hearty vote of thanks to mr     no pains spared to      solomons the subjects for the next two exhibitions are all optional the usual notice of the dates and the march subjects will be given     i am asked to state that the christian workers supplement forward has been omitted this week in consequence of the christmas holidays it will appear  as usual next issue     tue idea of having a christmas party at the poly for such of our members who would otherwise have spent the day   alone in london was admittedly such  a happy one that everybody now wants to know why it was not thought of before now that it has been tried the poly christmas party will probably be an annual event the institute was opened at noon and at one oclock a company of about seventy with mrand mrs quintin hogg as host and hostess sat down to that roast beef and plum pudding so typical of an english christmas day and thence throughout the day the party was as happy as could be the pro gramme previously arranged was followed pretty closely and gavegeneral satisfaction the afternoon was spent in listening to a service of song by the celia quartette and the carols and christmas pieces were illustrated by special lantern slides on the screen in the great hall a short address of welcome from mr quintin hogg was also given after tea there was a large accession of extra visitors for the evening service of song in which miss digby mr mansfield and mr turner took part dr lunn and mr mitchell delivered addresses and the lantern slides comprised some scenes in  the holy land supper was pro vided at  and the day closed with a short service that was  practically an exercise of family worship the intention was to provide a home from home on christmas day and for the feeling which prompted it as well as for the way in which it was provided the best and heartiest thanks are due to those who arranged it     mr puirie d armour who has spent about a quarter of a million of money in building and endowing an institute in chicago on similar lines to the poly looked in a day or two since and expressed himself as well pleased with all he saw mr armour takes a very lively interest in such works and said that he would be happy to welcome any of our fellows who may call at his institute in chicago     gilbert woolf has asked me to say that the old quintinian debating society will resume its sessions on thursday january  when all members are requested to be present in order to make a good start with the new year  is this true ladifsthe thing a woman never forgets to do is to try to read the postoffice mark on a letter be fore she opens it she will turn it upside down and look obliquely along its sur face and do everything in her power to make it out then if the indications are that it differs from the name of the town at the top of the letter she grows frantic with excitement and doesnt fairly get over it for days              h wew wears greeting from mr studd  my dear friendsas i cannot be with you in person i must send you by  letter mrs studds and my own heartiest  wishes for the new year may  be full not only of brightness and success but of that deeper joy which comes from a personal sense of the lord jesus christs presence with you may he whose first coming we have so recently commemo rated be your constant guide companion and friend increasing every joy sharing every sorrow and enabling you to over come every temptation  we feel it very hard to be exiled from the poly for so long a time and especially to be debarred from taking part in all the receptions you are now enjoying  we have eagerly scanned the poly imag each week to glean the latest poly intelligence and it has been a great pleasure to read of the successes which have attended every branch of our insti tute life  of course reading of all you are doing intensifies our longing to be taking part in the work but it is an ill wind that blows no one any good and if you have all the warmth of poly life poly work and poly success we enjoy the heat of that sun which you only see occasionally when the fog is less dense than usual we have now been here three weeks and with the exception of the last two days cloudless sunshine has been our lot with a coldish wind occasionally without wraps of any kind we have breakfasted in the open air at  am have frequently dined out in the middle of the day and i have several times had a swim in the open sea not once have we been kept indoors by cold or rain  you will agree with me that this is not a bad record of cannes weather weather of which you do not seem to get even a sample in london unless it be the windy sample  with such weather it will not surprise you to hear that i have greatly benefited by my visit and that with the exception of my leg which is still a little trouble some i can hardly be classified as an invalid  there is not much to do here except to wander on the rocks by the sea and walk into the country inland the most famous expedition is that to gourdon wd grasse and home by the  pont du loup this we undertook with some friends last tuesday and enjoyed immensely gour don is supposed to be the original home of the gordons but why they came from such a distance and from such a climate to settle in scotland is not stated  there is said to be a famous toad two or three centuries old in gourdon but as it only shows itself in foggy weather we did not see it if we had only had a magnum of london air i expect we should have been able to cause sufficient fog to entice the old gentleman from his lair  in spite of the warmth and sunshine our thoughts are with the polyand we hope to turn our faces homewards next week and after calling at florence venice and one or two other towns in north italy to reach the poly early in february  once more wishing you a very happy \f  the polytechnic  magazine  december       new year and hoping that the words of longfellow   not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end or way but to ask that each tomorrow find us farther than today  may be realised both in our individual life and in our poly life believe me yours sincerely j e k stupp  evening classes christmas examination in french  i have again much pleasure in sending the report of the result of our christmas examination in french it appears to me satisfactory save in the elementary class but as so many students came to their class with their work unprepared they cannot wonder at having failed i still regret to say that every year many of the students abstain from attending on the examination night it is a great mistake on their part for if they fail no one knows it but themselves and if they pass and do not wish their name to appear in the journal they have simply to mention it on their paper which a few of the students have done i forward a table as

engineers social  on monday the  inst the annual social reunion of past and present students of the school of engineering was held in marlborough rooms the platform had been decorated with plants and citizen ted price had evidently taxed his own and his assistants ingenuity in catering for the cravings of nature the tables being arranged as tastefully or more so than the writer has seen at any social he has attended in this great home of socials as to the pro gram improved orthography from the  progressive organs the usual poly adjectives such as stupendous colossal gigantic and appalling fail to describe the list of talent mustered by r a ruffle the energetic manager the first item on the elaborately printed pro gram was an overture  toronto by alex maclure one of the youngest of mr spooners lambs as the engineers are fondly called he was followed by mr bagandoji better known to his fellow members and students as julius thompson with a native song  made in lagos and responded to a twistlike demand for more with awfully clever h w lance mechanical section next obliged with a recitation entitled the collegian and  the porter tom hunter following with stephen adams masterpiece the island of dreams ernest wrights violin solo selection from the bohemian girl was greatly appreciated r a ruffle although suffering from a cold did full justice to the powder monkey giving as an encore the latest nautical song taken in tow ben nowell a rising lion comique late of the civil service school next gave the costers courtship and on being encored proved the truth of the saying that men were deceivers ever by immediately pro posing to another donah to become the future mrs awkins tom gordon representing the civil section concluded the first part of the evening with a violin solo which was deservedly encored the interval over nowell started the second part with arry and arriet lancers a selection from la cigale mr j p g smith sang the midshipmite and in reply to a richly deserved encore  the bay of biscay ernest wright having obliged with another violin solo nowell again trod the boards with  smiles and being recalled gave his experiences of certain unsophisticated mortals who refused just because they  didnt know the way the splendid voice of frank guyer of the marines in the longshoreman and the river of years was a revelation to most of the fellows harry platt electricals followed with a recita     tion describing the manners and customs of the  modern belle ra ruffle next sang i did laugh so did all the other fellows to such an extent that he was persuaded to reappear with  lum tumtididdlyum mr spooner having by this time arrived kindly consented to sing  true till death the writer having seldom heard a better rendering of this splendid song all regretting that mr spooner was unable to comply with the encore so enthusiastically called for ty gordon played the presentday rage the barn dance very skilfully hunter concluding a most successful evening with the tipperary christening and up to date the best thanks of the organ isers are due to messrs nowell and gordon for their accompaniments on pianoforte and violin the proceeds of the reunion have been devoted to the  christmas dinner for the poor fund an idea which is considered excellent by lupus  our sisters institute  gymnasium notesthere will be a practice in the small

last our annual competitions for novices were held in the small lecture hall before a large audience which tested its holding capacity to its fullest extent in some of the events the winners showed promising form while among the losers geddes wallace and jermin should be heard of again the following are the details st   competttiong geddes beat a green these youngsters were evenly matched in size and ability geddes forging ahead in the last round when green retired within ten seconds of time a murray beat j murphy the latter stood right over murray who is a brether of george of that ilk     murray made tracks fast with a straight left but murphys height and defence prevented much damage being done at outfighting murray had the best of the exchanges but at close quarters he lost himself and had all the worst of the scrambles pulling himself together in the last round murray displayed the better generalship and managed to secure the verdict although murphy made a very creditable show final bout  a murray beat g geddes murray started very fast but geddes countered him effectively and would not bestalled off the scoring was rather in favour of murray whose leadingoff propensities carried in front by the end of the second round coming up for the third time murray still forced the work but geddes who has an excel lent right crossed him splendidly time after time and had the better of the business up to the end of the round the judge however did not think he had done sufficient to wipe off the lead gained by murray in the first two rounds and the latter secured the verdict   competitionj ferguson beat e bevan there was a marked disparity in the sizes of these men ferguson being some inches taller than his sturdy opponent aided by his reach ferguson cut out the pace but bevan met him coolly every time and hitting the harder of the two looked like staying the longer the boxing was of a give and take character right up to the finish but fergusons extra reach enabled him to be  generally first in the exchanges and he won  st competitiong f kingham beat e ellerton the latter looked frail beside kingham who is a very strong boxer at the weight ellerton shaped very well but the heavier metal carried by kingham proved too much for his plucky opponent who had to put up with second place after an interesting bout j wallace beat j liddle wallace the shorter of the two posed the most artistically and repeatedly found his way to liddles dial by means of welldirected lefthanders summing up a sequence of points in the first round in the second round liddle held out his hand and retired final bout g f kingham beat j wallace wallace who was much below the stipulated weight soon looked like taking a big lead but kingham would not be denied and went after his man banging him heavily with both hands whenever opportunity offered there being little in it at the end of the first round the same style of boxing was indulged in during the remaining rounds wallace having the best of the earlier stages but kingham served by by his extra weight and strength gradually wore his opponent down and was declared the winner  st competitionj collins beat t chandler the latter took a most formidable lead in the first minute and ahalf and then retired for some reason best known to himself w r davey beat a bannister the latter is a bit of a rusher and shapes in rather peculiar style but davey standing well up to his work and hitting cleaner gained the decision after a well fought bout f hazzledine beat c s skeats a well matched pair hazzledine has a good left hand and got home repeatedly owing to skeats dropping his head each time he led off from start to finish hazzledine had the best of it but could not hit     skeats hard enough to stop him and the latter was loudly cheered by the specta tors for his grand display of courage under difficulties final bout f hazzledine beat j collins davey having injured his thumb retired and left the above two to decide who should possess the hand some medal collins a wellbuilt lad is well known for his allround athletic ability having distinguished himself both at running and cycling and was a com petitor in the recent long distance swimming championship jim had orders to cut out the work which he did at a lively bat but he was met every time with some splendid clean hard shots from hazzledines left the latter boxed very steadily and served by his extra reach had the best of someheavy fighting in which the staying powers of both men were severely tested the excitement was kept up right to the end of the third round when the award very properly went to hazzledine catch weightf¥ pollitzer beat g jerrim pollitzer who is of the greyhound breed looked very fit while jerrim appeared as hard as nails the latter was much the shorter of the twain but there could not be much between them in the matter of weight pollitzer led off with the left and repeated the liberty jerrim standing still and making very little attempt either to hit or guard pollitzer still kept up the pressure and at last jerrim let both hands go heavily which caused the long un to keep at a respectful distance up for the second round pollitzer welted his opponent some what severely in the ribs several times in succession to the intense amusement of jerrim who time after time failed to make use of himself when advantages occurred during the short rest he was severely admonished by his second which caused him to alter the aspect of affairs altogether and if he had forced the pace in the pre vious rounds the decision might have been different as it was using both hands with good effect he rapidly im proved his position but when the voice of the timekeeper stopped hostilities he had not scored sufficient in the eyes of the judges to secure the trophy which accordingly went to pollitzer the judg ing was kindly undertaken by messrs t gibson g ruskell and g sykes to whom we are much indebted the seconds were g j murray p h splatt a nollar arthur westley and jack harland the latter who will be married on sunday next to miss lucy wilkes at st johns church goose green peckham was asked by the hon sec to accept a purse of sovereigns sub scribed for by past and present members of the pbc as a token of the regard and esteem in which he has been held during his seven years connection with the club jack thanked the subscribers in his usual blunt honest manner and stated that his marriage will not sever him from the club in which he has spent so many happy hours and made so many friends

tary of mr woodhalls first chamber of commerce class as wellas a member of the shorthand society mr lumayes french classes mr mortons type writing class etc  up to september  last i was en gaged in the office of a firm of drug importers in london as shorihand corre spondent typewtiter invoice clerk etc at a salary of  per annum which considering my age  will no doubt be considered by some a fair remuneration t had however been led to believe by a friend of mine in chicago who formerly shared my rooms in london that there were better prospects here for a young fellow especially a stenographer  and ultimatelyimade up my mind to try the experiment after consultation with my employers they decided that they would like me to go to their new york office and they accordingly shipped me by the ltruria which left liverpool on the  september one of the principals ac companied me and the voyage taking it altogether was a very pleasant one  but of course most of us myself included went through the ceremony of feeding the fishes we arrived in new york barbour on saturday the  at about io am but owing to the quarantine restrictions were not allowed to enter dock until after inspection by the medical officer and for this we waited about seven hours we were passed through and reached the dock about  we were given to understand that ours was the only vessel out of five arriving in the har bour that day allowed to go through without being quarantined  the weather even at this time of the year was very hot  mosquitoes and other pests were still abundant and showed themselves in full force at the hotel near the dock where ij put up for the night  after securing rooms in brooklyn on the following monday i started work with the new york branch of our london firm and at the end of the week they required me to enter into an agreement with them for twelve months commencing with a salary of  dollars per week  might here mention that it is against the united states law to import jabour and we were therefore precluded from making any definite agreement before arrival from what i had gathered from the f smith premier and remington typewriter com panies i thought  dollars a week a     rather low salary to make an agreement upon and i flatly refused to entertain the idea the result was that we parted and i was then actually out of employ ment and in a strange country with no friends nor a single person whom i knew other than my late principais  of course i felt a little low but did not allow such a feeling to get the upper hand of me and i therefore set to work at once looking for another situation i had previously given my name to both the aforesaid typewriter companies and on application each favoured me with an introduction to a fim the one given me by the smith premier com pany was to tke democratic state committee of new jersey and i suc ceeded in obtaining a berth with them for six weeks at a salary of  dollars  my strongest recommendation here was ignorance and more especially ignorance of politics  knowing very little of democracy a little less of repub licanism and caring nothing about either seem to have filled the minds of the secretary and committee with admiration for my incapabilities  so much so that i was engaged there and then without being asked for any further testimonial i need hardly add that i filled the bill well the election as you know ended in a complete victory for our side and with clevelands election ended my en gagement with the democratic state committee it would occupy too much of your space to relate my experiences here i will only say that i never earned my wages so easily  hours were from  till   might also say that from observa tions made on the spot i have been led to believe that one of the qualifications of a prominent politician is that he shall be able to chew spit and smoke at all times and under all circumstances in justice to the democratic state committee of new jersey however i will say that i never worked for such a jolly jovial lot of  fellows in my life and i had a good many  situations in england the secretary favoured me with a splendid testimonial at the end of the campaign  on the very next day after leaving them i obtained my present berth with tattersalls of new york limited who as you undoubtedly know have a firm in london and elsewhere here my pros pects are good but the hours are rather long  it am given to understand that my experience has been quite an exceptional one as many fellows have been known to remain idle for months i do not know how far this is true but i think that a good stenographer would have no difficulty in obtaining employment here at  dollars per week to commence it must be borne in mind though that this is about equivalent to  per week in london  lodgings here are dear house rent is high but notwithstanding this it appears to me that many landladies pay the whole rent of an eightroomed house by letting about three rooms for my first room in brooklyn i paid  dollars per week nothing included except mosquitoes when in season  about a fortnight after my arrival  made the acquaintance of a young lon doner named watts formerly of hamp stead who tells me that he has sung at the  poly saturday concerts once or twice         we decided to take a room together and we have now for about two months occupied our present lodgings at  dollars a week including  was going to say attendance dusting our room once a month whether it requires it or not to do our landlady justice however i will say that she even makes up our laundry into a parcel and hands it to the laundry woman without charging anything extra this is generosity indeed for an american landlady so far as our present experience goes  houses here as a rule are better furnished than london houses nearly everyone being furnished with a bath room and heating apparatus i under stand that we get very cold weather here in winter but so far as i can gather yet i should be inclined to say that we stand a much better chance of being baked in doors than frozen outdoors what with stoves steam pipes gas etc the tem perature indoors becomes almost oppres sive even the railway trains are heated by steam to such an extend that in the depth of winter you are obliged to re move your overcoat to prevent perspira tion  both my friend watts and i belong to the ymca in brooklyn for  dollars a year you can become a member and join every class in the institute there is an extra fee of  dollars per annum for use of the gymnasium which is very dear in comparison to the benefits derived from the  dollars membership we have a nice large reading room drawing room games room etc but like every other house in the neighbourhood it suffers from the heat in winter i might here mention that the poly  is presented to the institute by a former member of the poly named frank davis who came out here about four years ago i met him at the institute spanish class about a month ago quite accidentally   am extremely satisfied with the climate so far as i have experienced it although in december the sun shines brightly for the greater part of the day and in not a single instance has it been necessary for us to climb the lamppost to see if the lamps are lit no london fogs here   need only add that  have every reason for being glad that i came out and if only all my friends were here i hardly think i should ever come back to england as it is  am hoping to be able to return in about twelve months to have a look at some of the old familiar faces at the poly among whom are tommy gimbert and g e dairey to whom please remember me  should any of your fellows decide on coming out i shall be pleased to give them any further information they may desire and if i can be of any use to mr mitchell between now and the poly trips next year i hope he will command me  yours very truly f m h woop    livingstonestreet  brooklyn ny usa december     you and jack sit next to

the play was of a very even character each goal being visited in turn but finally boswarva after a fine run sent in a shot which was too good for the nobillis goalkeeper the play contmued to be of a very even character to the end of the game boswarva again scored in the second half but the point was disallowed he being given offside the following represented the quintinians boswarva j miller w e

from free kicks a few yards from goal by a printers error our match with the naughts was reported as the e team and their secretary having seen the aag put in as stiff and as rough a lot as he had at

in a higher team where he stands more chance of good play this only refers to the com mencement of the season of course the naughts played a very rough game and our inside right forward came very

boiling by the pressure of that above thus the lower water becomes superheated and gradually heats the surface water which at last begins to boil this relieves the pressure on the water immediately below which being above its boiling point vaporises explosively and forces into the air a cloud of steam and a jet of the ever lying water this considerable relief from pressure is followed by louder explosions in the still hotter water beneath and more violent discharge of water jets and steam clouds into the air the explosions and discharges continue until the basin is emptied and the water in the conduits is chilled below its boiling point by exposure to the air the eruption then ceases and the water rises quietly in the basin until the conditions are suit able for another eruption

were bros j e€ studd and r mitchell the latter making the event one of the very few exceptions to his rule of not dining out of the poly \f  the polytechnic magazine november              the speeches during the evening were exceedingly good anecdotes poured out fast and furiously beginning with that of w bro white a member of our governing body who claimed an older membership of the poly than even our president ashe had attended classes at the institute nigh on forty years ago and had a clear récollection of going down into the bowels of the earth in the diving bell that diving bell was very like king charless head last saturday we could not get rid of it every speaker had either been in it or seen it or heard of it and round the writers table it was freely conjectured that bro mitchell was arrangingto send a waiter for it or that at any rate it would be secured within an hour or so forthe poly museum com pliments too were freely and generously lavished by our visitors upon our lodge officers whose work was eulogised as being exceptionally careful and satisfactory but as one speaker remarked that was only to be expected of work done at the poly   thenthe songs whoever arranged the programme deserves a jewel none were vulgar very many were funny and all were very pleasantly rendered bros herbert grover ber tram mills charles knowles and ambrose thorne were the vocalists bro s l

initiates it must have been especially so the calls for them during the evening directly the king had been toasted being hearty and plentiful am m        polytechnic parliament  afd wednesday october   this evening was devoted to the great question of the day viz the education bill the following motion was moved on behalf of our liberal government by the president of the education board mr parker  that this house strongly condemns the education bill now before the imperial parlia ment judging by the state of the liberal benches it seems very probable that this motion will be carried already a motion advocating home rule for ireland has passed this session so that it would seem as if the longlooked for revival of the liberal party at least as far as our house is concerned has begun in earnest for this state of affairs mr a j gelson the energetic liberal whip is probably chiefly responsible  mr t parker l in introducing the motion considered that the imperial government had no mandate to allow them to tamper with education the election was fought on a kharki issue and they were returned to power for the purpose of concluding the war it was a church of england bill and as such it was monstrous to compel the ratepayers to find the money to proselytize for any special creed or belief  mr eadie c contended that religious instruction as given in church of england schools in practice went very little beyond the undenominationalism of the board schools public opinion was strongly against the abandonment of religious teaching  mr d j morris l in a maiden speech strongly con demned the bill   mr graveline r ridiculed the bill as being neither good nor bad but simply useless our system of education needed great and immediate improvement but this bill did simply nothing   mr congdon c could not admit that the bill in any way favoured the established church he pointed out that if the parents of thirty children do not like the form of religious in struction given in the schools available to them they can apply to the local authorities education committee and have one built for them in which undenominational religious instruction can be provided  mr douglas r could see that religion was the last thing really in the minds of the framers of the bill the tories had subsidised a venal press and now wished to win over the churches children could always obtain sufficient religious in struction at sunday schools and bible classes   mr merriman l considered that the county and borough councils already had sufficient duties to perform with out having education thrust upon them the school boards did not deserve such summary treatment  mr warburton c said that the policy of the opposers of the bill was to squeeze the voluntary schools out of existence the country was not however prepared for such a drastic and expensive measure the bill was a decidedly progressive one     but as was invariably the case it was opposed by the liberals simply because it did not satisfy every one of their fads or petty requirements  mr brown l did not believe the bill was ever intended to benefit education it only created a disturbance of the existing system voluntary schools under private manage ment did not deserve to exist  the adjournment of the debate was moved by mr stanley r and carried without a division business for this evening will be the adjourned debate on the above motion  next wednesday mr d s douglas will move the follow ing motion that in the opinion of this house  the in efficiency of the officers of the british army and their present system of training and education calls for urgent and drastic reform   that in future all officers shall be promoted from the ranks   that any system of recruiting other than by voluntary enlistment

immediately afterwards smith scored with a splendid shot following an iridividual run right down the field further goals being scored by nunn and loosen we crossed over leading by  goals the second

     frank parks poly boxinc crus  amateur heavy weight champion of england  the studd trophy which is awarded annually for the best allround athletic performance of the year has this year been carried off by frank paiks of the boxing club as usual the cycists were well to the front with a redoubtable competitor in a l reed who has been remarkably successful on the path during the past year but frank parks hasbeen so uniformly successful from the commencement of his membership of the poly that the coveted honour fell to him frank parks joined the poly in  at the time knowing no more about boxing than any other ordinary member but he took to the sport joined the boxing club and immediately placed himself in the hands of professors jack harland and harry mead proving so apt a pupil in their hands that he easily carried off the novices competition in the following year this early success naturally had the effect of whetting his ambition for higher achievements and by dint of hard work and careful training he burst upon the boxing world in  as a formidable rival to the champions of that time in that year he carried off the stanhope open   and also won the volunteer champion ship he being a member of the  middlesex rv the london irish in the same year also he won the heavy weight competition of the german gymnasium repeating the performance in the following year in  and  he carried off the poly boxing clubs heavyweight champion ship and in  he improved upon these victories by winning the heavyweight championship of england here again he followed up his successes and maintained his championship in  and also for the current year so that in the case of frank parks we have a heavyweight boxer trained within our own \f the polytechnic magazine   november             walls who has held the championship of england for the past three years last june at two days notice he was called upon to defend his title against dodge of harvard university usa and here again he was able to demonstrate that the englishman is not in every way inferior to his american cousin for the invasion of dodge was repelled successfully and frank parks remains the first exponent of heavyweight boxing in england as can be readily imagined boxing has been parkss principal athletic hobby and physically he is a splendid example of the value of the fistic art as a developer of every muscle in the body but he is by no means a one sided champion and the officials of the boxing club judging by his performances on the wheel feel suré that while the boxing world has gained by his support the cycling club has lost the possibility of an exceedingly able champion on the path although frank parks has been a member of the in stitute for ten years he is but little known outside the gymnastic fraternity for although an excellent friend and a good fellow all round his modesty is so marked that he has never come to the front in any other sphere than the boxing world but those who know him value his friendship exceed ingly and know him to be grit right through although frank parks holds so prominent a position in the boxing world he has found time to establish a business on his own account as a lamp shade manufacturer at  nassau street w and from all accounts i hear that there is every prospect of his developing a successful business as would be expected of one who has had the courage and determination to make so excellent a record as he has in the athletic world  society and club reports reading circlethe circle opened its winter session on friday last with its annual
