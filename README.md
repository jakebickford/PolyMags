# PolyMags

This project aims to unlock new ways of accessing a digitised collection of historic magazines held by the University of Westminster Archive.

The Polytechnic Magazine was the in-house magazine of the [Regent Street Polytechnic](https://westminster-atom.arkivum.net/index.php/rsp), one of the predecessor institutions of the [University of Westminster](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/). Since 2011, a digitised run of more than 1,700 issues of the magazine covering the years 1879 to 1960 has been made available by the [University Archive](http://recordsandarchives.westminster.ac.uk/). This has proved an invaluable resource for academic researchers, family historians and university staff. You can search and read the digitised magazines themselves via the University Archive's [Polymags site](https://polymags.westminster.ac.uk/).

This project aims to complement the existing resource by opening up computational methods of access to the collection.

## The following outputs from the project are available
